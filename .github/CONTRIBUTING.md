# Contributing to translationStudio Desktop
Thank you for your help!

## Have some code?
If you would like to contribute to this project please read [How to Contribute](https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/ts-requirements/wiki/How-to-Contribute) first. That article covers general information for contributing to this and related [unfoldingWord](https://unfoldingword.org/) projects.

When you are ready to submit your code please check the following first:
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] You have pulled in the latest changes from the upstream `develop` branch (See [syncing a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) for details).
- [ ] The branch you are submitting follows the nomenclature described in the [Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

## Find a bug?
First: **Are you using the [latest version](https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/ts-desktop/releases/latest) of the app?**

Not everyone needs to be a programmer to help. If you have found a bug in the program [submit an issue](https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/ts-desktop/issues/new)! Please remember we are programmers not mind readers. We do not know what you see or experience unless you say it in detail (screenshots are welcome too!). 

When submitting an issue please check that no one else has already opened a similar issue. Duplicate issues will only consume more time and delay getting the bug fixed. If you can add more clarity to an existing issue add a comment on it rather than opening a new issue.
