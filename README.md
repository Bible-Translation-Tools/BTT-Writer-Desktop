* `$ gulp lint --fix` same as above, but attempts to fix the JS styles for you
* `$ gulp test` runs all Mocha unit tests
* `$ gulp test --grep [string]` runs the Mocha unit tests that match the string
* `$ gulp` runs the `lint` and `test` tasks
* `$ npm start` runs the application (without building it)
