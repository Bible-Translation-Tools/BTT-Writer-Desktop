            <h1>Translation Guidelines</h1>
            <p>To create a translation of high quality we recommend the following guidelines:</p>
            <p>
              <strong>1. Accurate</strong> - Translate accurately, without changing the meaning of the original text. Translated content should faithfully communicate as precisely as possible the meaning of the original text as it would have been understood by the original audience. Translators can achieve accuracy by recognizing the authority of the original language texts, and researching Biblical language tools to clarify difficulties.
              <br/><br/><strong>2. Faithful</strong> - Avoid theological or other bias in your translation. Use key terms that are faithful to the vocabulary of the original biblical languages. <b>Use equivalent, biological, common language terms for the biblical words that describe the relationship between God the Father and God the Son.</b> These may be clarified, as needed, in footnotes or other supplemental resources.
              <br/><br/><strong>3. Historical</strong> - Communicate historical events and facts accurately, providing additional information as needed in order to accurately communicate the intended message to people who do not share the same context and culture as the original recipients of the original content.
              <br/><br/><strong>4. Clear and Natural</strong> - Use whatever language structures are necessary to achieve the highest level of comprehension, complying with common form and flow in the target language.
            </p>
            <p> We believe that a translation has the highest likelihood of being good quality when after applying the guidelines above, the following are completed: </p>
            <ol>
            <li>It is tested and approved by believers of the language community and their church leaders.</li>
            <li>Ongoing revisions and improvements are made.</li>
            </ol>
