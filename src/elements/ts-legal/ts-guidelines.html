            <h1>Translation Guidelines</h1>
            <p>
              <strong>Accurate</strong>
              <br/>Accurate translations effectively communicate the intended meaning of the original, divinely inspired text. An accurate translation expresses the meaning the author intended for the original audience in the original context.
              <ol>
                <li>To the extent that is possible, nothing is added, misconstrued, or deleted from the original message.</li>
                <li>It does not recast the meaning of the original text to make it more relevant to the contemporary audience.</li>
                <li>An accurate translation does not distort the meaning in order to favor a specific interpretive perspective. It should be free from theological, cultural, or personal biases.</li>
                <li>An accurate translation communicates historical events and facts accurately.</li>
              </ol>
              <br/>
              <strong>Clear</strong>
              <br/>Clear translations will use whatever language structures are needed to help readers easily read and understand it.
              <ol>
                  <li>A clear translation may use as many or as few terms as necessary to communicate the original meaning as clearly as possible.</li>
                  <li>Making a clear translation does not mean that the translator clarifies something that is ambiguous in the source text.</li>
                  <li>Making a clear translation does not mean that the translator gives the reader a specific interpretation for every passage where meaning is genuinely debated.</li>
              </ol>
              <br/>
              <strong>Natural</strong>
              <br/>Natural translations use language forms that are reflect the way the target language is used in corresponding contexts.
              <ol>
                  <li>Natural Bible translations sound like they were produced by an adult native speaker who speaks and/or writes well.</li>
                  <li>A natural Bible translation does not use expressions that are particular to their own culture in order to make the translation appear natural.</li>
                  <li>It is more important for a portion of Scripture to be translated accurately than for it to sound perfectly natural to everyone who reads it.</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p> We believe that a translation has the highest likelihood of being good quality when after applying the guidelines above, the following are completed: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>It is tested and approved by believers of the language community and their church leaders.</li>
                <li>Ongoing revisions and improvements are made.</li>
            </ol>
